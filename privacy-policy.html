  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    PPT Send System respects user privacy. This application is designed to
    allow users to send emails using their own Gmail accounts.
  </p>

  <h2>Gmail Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    We request access only to the Gmail sending permission
    (<strong>gmail.send</strong>) to send emails on behalf of the user.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do NOT read Gmail inbox messages.</li>
    <li>We do NOT store Gmail message content.</li>
    <li>We do NOT share Gmail data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    We securely store OAuth refresh tokens only to maintain Gmail sending
    functionality. Users can revoke access at any time from their Google
    Account settings.
  </p>

  <h2>User Control</h2>
  <p>
    Users have full control over their data and may disconnect Gmail access
    at any time.
